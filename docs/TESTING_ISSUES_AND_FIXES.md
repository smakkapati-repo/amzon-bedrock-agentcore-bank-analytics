## üêõ Issues Found

### Issue 1: Upload Document Mode - No AI Summary Generated
**Problem:** When uploading PDFs in local mode, the system shows "Unknown Bank" and doesn't extract bank information.

**Root Cause:** 
- The backend tries to pass entire base64 PDF content through the prompt
- This exceeds token limits and causes the agent to fail silently
- Falls back to "Unknown Bank" default

**Current Code Flow:**
```javascript
// backend/server.js line 138-148
const prompt = `Use the analyze_and_upload_pdf tool to upload this PDF...
File: ${file.name}
Content: ${file.content}  // ‚ùå This is 20MB+ of base64!
...`;
```

**Fix Required:**
1. Use the `analyze_and_upload_pdf` tool properly with file content as a separate parameter
2. OR: Extract text from PDF first, then analyze the text
3. OR: Upload to S3 first, then ask agent to analyze from S3

---

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Document Counts in Live Mode
**Problem:** Different banks return different numbers of SEC filings
- US Bank Corp: 7 documents (2 10-K + 5 10-Q)
- Bank of America: 4 documents

**Possible Causes:**
1. SEC EDGAR API rate limiting
2. Different filing patterns (some banks file more frequently)
3. Search query limitations in the agent tool
4. Date range filtering differences

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if this is expected behavior (banks actually have different filing counts)
- Or if it's a technical limitation in the SEC data retrieval

---

### Issue 3: No AI Summary in Upload Mode
**Problem:** After uploading a PDF, clicking "Full Financial Analysis Report" doesn't generate a summary.

**Root Cause:** Same as Issue 1 - the agent can't properly analyze the PDF because:
1. PDF content isn't being passed correctly to the agent
2. Agent doesn't have access to the uploaded S3 file
3. The `analyze_and_upload_pdf` tool isn't being invoked properly

**Current Behavior:**
```
Uploaded Documents
10-K Unknown Bank - 10-K 2025
File: 2024-AR.pdf (20.31 MB)

Agent Response:
"I'd be happy to generate a comprehensive financial report, but I need to know 
which bank you'd like me to analyze. 'Unknown Bank' isn't a specific institution."
```

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Uploaded Documents
10-K Webster Financial Corporation - 10-K 2024
File: 2024-AR.pdf (20.31 MB)

Agent Response:
[Comprehensive financial analysis of Webster Financial Corporation...]
```

## üîß Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix PDF Upload and Analysis

**Option A: Two-Step Process (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Step 1: Upload to S3 directly from backend
const s3Key = await uploadToS3(file.content, file.name);

// Step 2: Ask agent to analyze using S3 key
const prompt = `Analyze the PDF document at S3 key: ${s3Key}
Extract: bank name, document type, fiscal year
Then generate a summary.`;
```

**Option B: Extract Text First**
```javascript
// Use pdf-parse library to extract text
const pdfText = await extractTextFromPDF(file.content);

// Send only the text (first 10k chars) to agent
const prompt = `Analyze this SEC filing excerpt:
${pdfText.substring(0, 10000)}

Extract: bank name, document type, year`;
```

### Priority 2: Investigate SEC Filing Counts
- Add logging to see how many documents SEC EDGAR returns
- Check if rate limiting is occurring
- Verify date ranges being used in queries

### Priority 3: Add Better Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages when PDF analysis fails
- Add retry logic for failed uploads
- Display progress indicators during long operations

## üìä Data Source Verification

### Peer Analytics Data
**Confirmed:** Uses **REAL FDIC data**, not mock data
- Source: `api.getFDICData()` ‚Üí backend agent ‚Üí FDIC Call Reports
- Time Period: 2023-2025
- Update Frequency: Quarterly for most metrics
- Mock data exists in code but is only used as fallback if API fails

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix PDF upload to properly extract bank name
2. **Short-term:** Implement proper PDF analysis workflow
3. **Medium-term:** Investigate and fix SEC filing count inconsistencies
4. **Long-term:** Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
