# BankIQ+ - AI Banking Analytics Platform (**Powered by [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html)**) 


**Authors:** Shashi Makkapati, Senthil Kamala Rathinam, Jacob Scheatzle

> **Technology Showcase**: This project demonstrates the capabilities of **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** (AWS's new managed agent runtime) and the **Strands framework** for building production-ready AI agents with tool orchestration, conversational memory, and enterprise-grade security.

## üöÄ Why This Project Matters

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore + Strands Framework
This is a **reference implementation** showcasing:
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** - AWS's newly launched managed agent runtime (announced October 2025)
- **Strands Framework** - Python-based agent orchestration with 12 custom tools
- **Production Architecture** - CloudFront + ECS + Cognito + AgentCore (no API Gateway)
- **Conversational Memory** - Multi-turn conversations with context retention
- **Tool Orchestration** - Claude Sonnet 4.5 automatically selects from 12 specialized tools
- **Enterprise Security** - JWT authentication, IAM roles, private subnets

### Banking Analytics Use Case
The advent of Generative AI has revolutionized how financial institutions process and interpret complex banking data. BankIQ+ represents a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based analytics to intelligent, context-aware financial analysis. By integrating Amazon Bedrock AgentCore with Claude Sonnet 4.5, real-time FDIC data, and SEC EDGAR filings, the platform doesn't just present numbers‚Äîit understands relationships between metrics, identifies emerging trends, and generates human-like insights.

The AI agent can instantly correlate a bank's declining Net Interest Margin with industry-wide patterns, explain strategic implications of capital changes, or predict potential regulatory concerns based on CRE concentration trends. This GenAI-powered approach transforms raw regulatory data into conversational insights, enabling bank executives to ask natural language questions like "Why is our ROA underperforming compared to similar-sized banks?" and receive comprehensive, contextual analysis that considers market conditions, regulatory environment, and peer performance.

- **Application Load Balancer**: Routes API traffic to ECS containers
- **ECS Fargate**: Serverless containers in private subnets with JWT verification
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: Managed AI agent runtime with 12 tools
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Advanced AI analysis and conversational memory
- **S3 Storage**: Frontend hosting and document uploads
- **VPC with Multi-AZ**: High availability deployment
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for secure access
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Architecture Deep Dive

BankIQ+ follows a modern, cloud-native architecture built on AWS services with security-first design. User requests flow through [CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) for global content delivery, routing static files from [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and API calls to the [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). The ALB distributes traffic to containerized applications running on [Amazon ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html), eliminating server management while providing automatic scaling.

The platform's intelligence comes from [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html), which orchestrates 12 specialized tools for banking analytics. The agent uses [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) for natural language understanding and maintains conversational memory across sessions. External data integration includes FDIC APIs for real-time banking metrics and SEC EDGAR APIs for financial filings. Documents uploaded to S3 are analyzed using PyPDF2 for metadata extraction and Claude for comprehensive analysis.

Security is embedded throughout: [AWS Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/) provides enterprise-grade authentication with OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens, Fargate containers run in private subnets with JWT verification, [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) provide fine-grained access control, and [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) enables comprehensive monitoring. The architecture eliminates API Gateway's 30-second timeout limitation, supporting long-running queries up to 300 seconds. Infrastructure is deployed through [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments.

## üéØ AI Agent Tools (12 Custom Tools)

**Strands Framework Implementation** - Each tool is a Python function with:
- Input/output schemas (Pydantic models)
- Error handling and validation
- Integration with external APIs (FDIC, SEC EDGAR)
- S3 operations for document storage

1. `get_fdic_data` - Current FDIC banking data (live API integration)
2. `search_fdic_bank` - Search FDIC by bank name
3. `compare_banks` - Peer performance comparison with trend analysis
4. `get_sec_filings` - SEC EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q)
5. `generate_bank_report` - Comprehensive multi-metric analysis
6. `answer_banking_question` - General Q&A with context
7. `search_banks` - Bank search by name/ticker (500+ banks)
8. `upload_csv_to_s3` - Upload CSV data with validation
9. `analyze_csv_peer_performance` - Analyze custom CSV data

12. `chat_with_documents` - Multi-turn document Q&A with memory

**Tool Orchestration**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 automatically selects the right tool(s) based on user intent. For example:
- "Compare JPMorgan and Bank of America ROA" ‚Üí `compare_banks` tool
- "What are Webster's key risks?" ‚Üí `get_sec_filings` + `chat_with_documents` tools
- "Analyze my custom peer data" ‚Üí `upload_csv_to_s3` + `analyze_csv_peer_performance` tools

## üåü Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Highlights

```

Open the CloudFront URL in your browser to access BankIQ+!

## üîç Verify Deployment

**Check Health:**
```bash
# Get CloudFront URL
CLOUDFRONT_URL=$(aws cloudfront list-distributions --query "DistributionList.Items[?contains(Origins.Items[0].DomainName, 'bankiq-frontend')].DomainName" --output text)

# Test health endpoint
curl https://$CLOUDFRONT_URL/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","service":"BankIQ+ Backend"}
```

**View Logs:**
```bash
# ECS backend logs
aws logs tail /ecs/bankiq-backend --follow

# AgentCore logs
agentcore status
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

Monthly costs (24/7 operation):
- ECS Fargate: $15-20
- ALB: $16-20
- CloudFront: $1-5
- S3: $1-2
- Bedrock: $10-30

**Total**: ~$50-90/month

## üßπ Cleanup

```bash
# View ECS logs
aws logs tail /ecs/bankiq-backend --follow

# View AgentCore logs
agentcore status
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Issue**: CloudFront returns 502
- Check ECS task health
- Check ALB target health
- View logs: `aws logs tail /ecs/bankiq-backend --follow`

**Issue**: Agent not responding
- Check AgentCore status: `agentcore status`
- Verify agent ARN in ECS task environment variables
