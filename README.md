**Authors:** Shashi Makkapati, Senthil Kamala Rathinam, Jacob Scheatzle

> **ü§ñ AgentCore Version**: This repository contains the AWS Bedrock AgentCore implementation with Strands tools for intelligent banking analytics.

## Background & Strategic Context

In today's competitive banking landscape, financial institutions require sophisticated peer analysis capabilities to maintain regulatory compliance, optimize performance, and make strategic decisions. Traditional banking analytics often rely on static reports and manual processes, creating delays in identifying market trends and competitive positioning. Banks need real-time access to standardized financial metrics across peer institutions to benchmark their performance against industry leaders, assess risk exposure, and demonstrate regulatory compliance to federal agencies like the FDIC and Federal Reserve.

The advent of Generative AI has revolutionized how financial institutions can process and interpret complex banking data. This Banking Peer Analytics platform represents a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based analytics to intelligent, context-aware financial analysis. By integrating Amazon Bedrock's Claude AI with real-time FDIC data and SEC EDGAR filings, the platform doesn't just present numbers‚Äîit understands relationships between metrics, identifies emerging trends, and generates human-like insights that would typically require teams of financial analysts.

The AI can instantly correlate a bank's declining Net Interest Margin with industry-wide patterns, explain the strategic implications of Tier 1 Capital changes, or predict potential regulatory concerns based on CRE concentration trends. This GenAI-powered approach transforms raw regulatory data into conversational insights, enabling bank executives to ask natural language questions like "Why is our ROA underperforming compared to similar-sized banks?" and receive comprehensive, contextual analysis that considers market conditions, regulatory environment, and peer performance.

### Architecture Deep Dive

The BankIQ+ platform follows a modern, serverless architecture built on AWS services with clear separation of concerns and security-first design. The user journey begins when banking analysts and executives access the platform through their web browsers **(Step 1)**, with HTTPS requests flowing to AWS's [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) and then to the IP-restricted [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). The load balancer routes traffic to the React UI container running on [Amazon ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) in private subnets **(Step 2)**. This serverless container approach eliminates EC2 instance management while providing automatic scaling. The UI container serves the React frontend with nginx and communicates with backend services through [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

The platform's intelligence comes from its sophisticated AgentCore Runtime integration. UI API calls flow to [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) **(Step 3)**, which proxies requests through a [Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) **(Step 4)** to the [Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) **(Step 5)**. The AgentCore Runtime hosts a Strands agent with 11 specialized banking tools, powered by [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html) **(Step 6)** for intelligent financial analysis. The agent directly integrates with external data sources including FDIC Call Reports for 2024-2025 banking metrics and SEC EDGAR APIs for real-time financial filings **(Steps 7-8)**. Document uploads are handled through [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) integration **(Step 9)**, enabling secure storage and analysis of financial documents.

Security and operational excellence are embedded throughout the architecture via AWS's shared responsibility model. The UI containers run in [private subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) with no direct internet access, communicating externally through a [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) for enhanced security isolation. [IAM roles and policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) provide fine-grained access control with minimal permissions for Bedrock AgentCore access and S3 operations. The AgentCore Runtime operates as a managed service, eliminating the need for backend infrastructure management while providing enterprise-grade security and compliance. [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) provides comprehensive logging and monitoring across all services, with X-Ray tracing for AgentCore operations. The entire infrastructure is deployed through [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) templates with a single interactive deployment script, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments with built-in quota checks and security controls.

- Review CloudWatch logs for detailed errors
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

### Getting Help

**Before Deployment:**
- Ensure you have AWS admin permissions
- Verify Bedrock model access is approved
- Confirm your IP address is correct

**During Deployment:**
- Monitor CloudFormation Events tab for progress
- Deployment typically takes 10-15 minutes
- Red events indicate issues (check IAM permissions)

**After Deployment:**
- Check AWS CloudWatch logs: `/ecs/bankiq-ui` and Lambda logs
- Review AgentCore Runtime traces in X-Ray console
- Verify Security Group allows your current IP
- Test with different browsers if needed
- Validate AgentCore agent deployment in Bedrock console

**Common Solutions:**
