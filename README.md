**Authors:** Shashi Makkapati, Senthil Kamala Rathinam, Jacob Scheatzle

> **ü§ñ AgentCore Version**: This repository contains the AWS Bedrock AgentCore implementation with Strands tools for intelligent banking analytics.

## Background & Strategic Context

In today's competitive banking landscape, financial institutions require sophisticated peer analysis capabilities to maintain regulatory compliance, optimize performance, and make strategic decisions. Traditional banking analytics often rely on static reports and manual processes, creating delays in identifying market trends and competitive positioning. Banks need real-time access to standardized financial metrics across peer institutions to benchmark their performance against industry leaders, assess risk exposure, and demonstrate regulatory compliance to federal agencies like the FDIC and Federal Reserve.

The advent of Generative AI has revolutionized how financial institutions can process and interpret complex banking data. This Banking Peer Analytics platform represents a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based analytics to intelligent, context-aware financial analysis. By integrating Amazon Bedrock's Claude AI with real-time FDIC data and SEC EDGAR filings, the platform doesn't just present numbers‚Äîit understands relationships between metrics, identifies emerging trends, and generates human-like insights that would typically require teams of financial analysts.

The AI can instantly correlate a bank's declining Net Interest Margin with industry-wide patterns, explain the strategic implications of Tier 1 Capital changes, or predict potential regulatory concerns based on CRE concentration trends. This GenAI-powered approach transforms raw regulatory data into conversational insights, enabling bank executives to ask natural language questions like "Why is our ROA underperforming compared to similar-sized banks?" and receive comprehensive, contextual analysis that considers market conditions, regulatory environment, and peer performance.

## üèóÔ∏è AWS Architecture

**Key Components:**
- **VPC with Public/Private Subnets**: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- **Application Load Balancer**: IP-restricted access (your IP only)
- **ECS Fargate**: Serverless containers in private subnets
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Claude 3 Haiku/Sonnet for AI analysis
- **Amazon Titan**: Embeddings V2 for RAG search
- **NAT Gateway**: Secure outbound internet access
- **Security Groups**: Network-level security controls
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for Bedrock access
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Architecture Deep Dive

The BankIQ+ platform follows a modern, cloud-native architecture built on AWS services with a clear separation of concerns and security-first design. The user journey begins when banking analysts and executives access the platform through their web browsers **(Step 1)**, with HTTP requests flowing directly to AWS's [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) and then to the [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). The load balancer serves as the entry point, intelligently routing traffic to the containerized application running on [Amazon ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) **(Step 2)**. This serverless container approach eliminates the need for EC2 instance management while providing automatic scaling based on demand. The core application consists of a React frontend and Flask API backend, packaged as a single container and deployed through [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) for container registry management.

The platform's intelligence comes from its sophisticated data integration and AI processing capabilities. The containerized application orchestrates multiple data streams, connecting to external data sources including FDIC APIs for real-time banking metrics and SEC EDGAR APIs for comprehensive financial reports **(Step 3)**. This external data is then processed through [Amazon Bedrock's](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) Claude 3.5 Sonnet model **(Step 4)** for intelligent financial analysis, while a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database **(Step 5)** enables rapid similarity searches across financial documents. The FAISS integration works alongside Amazon Bedrock's [Titan Embeddings V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html) model to convert financial documents into high-dimensional vectors, enabling the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode that provides instant access to relevant financial information before sending context to Claude for analysis. The architecture includes robust data management through [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) for document storage **(Step 6)**, with in-memory caching using Pandas DataFrames handled directly within the Fargate container to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

Security and operational excellence are embedded throughout the architecture via AWS's shared responsibility model. The Fargate containers run in [private subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) with no direct internet access, communicating externally through a [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) for enhanced security isolation. [IAM roles and policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) provide fine-grained access control, ensuring the Fargate containers have only the minimum permissions required for Bedrock AI services and external API access. [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) securely stores API keys and credentials, while [Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) handles configuration management. [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) provides comprehensive logging and monitoring across all services, enabling proactive issue detection and performance optimization. The entire infrastructure is deployed through [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) templates, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments with built-in security groups that restrict access to specific IP addresses, creating a secure, enterprise-grade banking analytics platform that scales automatically while maintaining strict security controls.
